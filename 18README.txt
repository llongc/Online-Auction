1. Our project is a general headphones auction website, and our function is as same as the project
checklist file. 

2. How we define two items are same

In order to make our auction website as variety as possible, we decide to let seller to type 
their own item name for their products. However, we soon find it cause a problem when we trying 
to define what can be seen as the "same item", and meanwhile, sales report part of the auction site
require the "best-selling items". Since we were already finish the most parts of our project, it was 
too late when we realize this problem. One way we thought about for this issue is to limit the name 
of headphones when seller post their items, but we are not able to having all options for seller to 
choose. Meanwhile, sellers might have two different names for a same item or two same names for 
different items, therefore it is also not accurate to compare items' name. We user our own definition
which is two items are same when they have same condition, type, connectivities, connector size,
color and use. We also have this definition in our jsp code as comment when we implement this rule.
